###To achieve periodic report generation within a Docker container, you can use a combination of Docker's capabilities and a scheduling mechanism. One common approach is to use cron, a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like operating systems. Here's how you can create a Docker container that periodically generates reports:

Dockerfile: Create a Dockerfile to define the container's environment and dependencies.
Python Script: Write a Python script to fetch data from the Hugging Face model hub and generate the report.
Cron Job Configuration: Set up a cron job within the Docker container to periodically execute the Python script.
